Hello! My name is Kryštof Sláma (Christopher), I'm 20 years old, from Czech Republic and I'm in first year at Czech University of Agriculture (ČZU) field Informatics, i'm passionate about technology and Apple ecosystem development. I started programming few time when I was younger, but only to try. I started learning programming about a year ago and it immersed me, so I would say that so far I am self-taught developer. To Swift I got about 6 months back and then learned about Swift Student Challange.

##About HANDY
     I get the idea for Handy from my friend from secondary school, who is professional photo/videographer about two years ago he started to had hand tremosrs. But last year it got worse. His doctor gave him some exercises and it got better. When I learned about Apple Swift Student challenge, I had some Ideas, but nothing I fell like it was worth it, would help, so the I remembred about him and build it.
     In the end of the time for submitting, I didn't have much time with school. So in the exercise list, I couldn't manage to make images for all exercises.

Handy was designed to run on Apple Ipad Air (5th generation) in landscaped mode. For gyroscope movement I inspired in Apple BubbleLevel playground template.
